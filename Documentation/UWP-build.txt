BUILDING
===============
I'm slightly new to building things for UWP and even more inexperienced with scons.  Sorry for the headache but to build you need a clean mingw environment.  If you've installed SDL2 previously it may collide.

Clone and build SDL2_image/SDL2_mixer/libpng with cmake using a WindowsStore configuration.  Update path in SConstruct accordingly.

You will need to build aerisarns mesa-uwp/SDL-uwp-gl projects and update the paths for those dependencies.

You can now build the main dll used in the UWP application with the following command:
`time nice scons -j$(nproc) sdl2=1 d1x=1 CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ adlmidi=runtime`

Once the DLL is built, update the UWP project file with paths to your mingw dll's and custom built dlls.  From there you can build the app and run it.

My builds are purposefully left with a bit of headache to discourage thievery and pushes to retail.  Apologies in advance.  I can assist with official adoptations with a cleaner config if desired.
